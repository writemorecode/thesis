= Conclusion

In this report, we have studied a job scheduling problem, presenting and evaluating a number of algorithms for solving it.
Evaluating these algorithms, we found that simpler algorithms can greatly outperform more complex algorithms.
We can conclude that the best algorithms were simple, and used intelligent heuristics.
We found that it is better, and easier, to try to find a good solution directly, rather than to try to move from a poor solution to a good solution.
