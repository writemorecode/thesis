In 2010, Speitkamp and Bichler @speitkamp_bichler_2010 described a server consolidation problem.
The authors presented an LP-based formulation of the problem, and a solution using a heuristic based on LP-relaxation. 
They also showed that the problem is strongly NP-hard, by reducing the problem to the multidimensional bin-packing problem (MDBP).

In 2012, Setzer and Wolke @setzer_wolke_2018 formulated a mathematical model for scheduling virtual machines in data centers.
This model was optimized for minimizing the number of powered-on physical machines over time, while also attempting to minimize the overhead from virtual machine migration between physical machines.

In 2013, Ghribi et al. @ghribi_hadji_djamal_2013 presented two exact algorithms for energy-efficient cloud job scheduling.

In 2016, Mosa and Paton @mosa_paton_2016 developed an optimized energy- and SLA-aware virtual machine placement strategy based on genetic algorithms.

In 2018, Lei et al. @liu_li_li_2018 presented, analyzed, and benchmarked a randomized approximation algorithm for solving the minimal cost job-server configuration problem.
